WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SO FAR:
Implementation of basic layout / input methods of webpage
Most (but not all) theory rules are in place
A finished hymn can be converted into ABC but not well-notated

CHALLENGES:
Built-in dropdowns and checkboxes were hard to implement correctly
Getting Git to work in everyone's favor

GOALS:
Allow user-selected chords to display in a grid on webpage
Improve responsive design
Implement additional theory rules
Handle rhythm, barlines, and other exceptions in ABC
