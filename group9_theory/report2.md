STATUS REPORT #2

WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED SINCE THE LAST REPORT:
Theory rules are now FINISHED!
A finished hymn can now be converted perfectly into ABC
Responsive design has been implemented

CHALLENGES:
Finding time.

GOALS:
Improve efficiency of theory.js
Convert ABC into MIDI and a visual score
Link front-end and back-end into a fully functional (but not complete) page
Start implementing "pick 5"s

OTHER NOTES
To use geolocation, we're no longer "just for kicks" generating a random
piece based on their location. We are now giving them a different example
piece depending on their location, based on famous works by composers from
their area of the world. < cool!
