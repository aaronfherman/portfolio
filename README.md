Aaron Herman -- COMP 20 work

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the work that I did for
COMP 20: Web Programming when I took it at Tufts in Fall 2015.

My favorite assignment was the first assignment (not currently in this
repository), where we were asked to write an online resume using our
new knowledge of HTML and CSS. I liked it because it showed that even
the few skills we had learned in the course up to that point could be
used to create something very useful.

I think that as a programmer, I have developed the ability to work in
a wider variety of contexts as a result of this course. Before this class, I 
only knew C++. Now I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well, and have more
faith in my ability to adapt to new languages. I also learned how to WRITE a
spec for the first time for my semester group project (subfolder group9_theory),
when I had to describe what properties a chord could or could not have to make
things easier for my less music-theory-inclined groupmates.

The most important lesson I learned in this course was that the real world is
extremely complicated. An example of this is security, in which the number of
possible ways someone could exploit or break your site is too much to cover
as a subunit of a web programming course. Another example is responsive design,
since the various devices on which a person can view the Web are many and are
only going to increase in number.

I might like to delve deeper into the topic of user interfaces. One thing that
always bothered me about COMP 11 and 15, the first two courses I took, was
that all programs were designed for the console, which is used exclusively by
other programmers. COMP 20 was the first computer science course where I
was able to deliver things that the general public would know how to use.
