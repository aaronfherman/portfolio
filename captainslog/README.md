Lab 7: Captain's Log

Most aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented; the local
storage works and the messages are printed out in the correct order with
correct, human-readable timestamps. However, the text entry box does not
become empty after the typed message has been logged, and as a corollary
to that, it will not let you submit the same message twice in a row because
you will not have changed the text box, but it will let you submit empty
messages. Furthermore, de-selecting the text box has the same effect as
hitting enter because they both trigger the "change" event.

I have not collaborated with anyone or discussed this assignment, except
on Piazza.
